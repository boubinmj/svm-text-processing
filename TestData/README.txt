As of right now, I am collecting data from 4 different scenarios.  Each separated into a unique folder.

The data contents include the following 4 categories:

1. Low Levels of Acetone (1uL)
2. High Levels of Acetone (5uL)

3. Low Levels of Ethanol (0uL)
4. High Levels of Ethanol (0.05uL)

Right now, the primary focus of my experiment is to determine a difference in the signal received
by the low levels of Acetone test and the signal received by the High levels of Acetone Test.

Right now I only have acetone data.   

Each folder contains a spreadsheet containing one sheet for each test that has been conducted.
The Spreadsheet is in open office document format.  Google Sheets and Excel should recognize this format.
Let me know if you have issues opening any of these documents.

Each line in a given sheet is a sample taken at a given time.
Each test contains 5 quantities.

1. Time (in Seconds)
2. Voltage from TGS - 2620
3. Voltage from TGS - 2612
4. Voltage from TGS - 2602
5. Voltage from Figargo - 2620

The voltages are all between 0V and 5V.  The voltage is represented by a 10 bit integer (between 0 and 1023).
If you are interested in the response in volts, let me know and I will do the calculations for you.

In each of the folders, I have provided you of a graph that represents the general trend of the data from that particular test.
The test were conducted as follows:

Step 1: Measured Data Before System was turned on (0 - 60 seconds)
Step 2: Turned system valve on to push data into system (60 - 105 seconds)
Step 3: Turned system valve off to view stead state data (105 - 420 seconds)
Step 4: Turned system valve on to flush system (420 - 600 seconds)

I think that the stead state data (105 - 420 seconds) will be most valuable for what you are trying to do.
But if you want to use the other data that is fine.
